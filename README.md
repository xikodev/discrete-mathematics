### Problem

For given nonnegative integers a, b, c, d and e, and a natural number L, your task is to determine how many
words of length L exist, under the restriction that they consist only of the letters A, B, C, D, and E, and that
each of these letters appears at most a, b, c, d, and e times, respectively.
Note: The program is expected to handle inputs satisfying a, b, c, d, e ≤ 10 and L ≤ 25. Instructors may
still ask you to input and test examples outside of these limits.

### Example Input

You enter the parameters a, b, c, d, e and L via the command line. An example of command-line input looks like
this:

```
2 2 2 2 2
10
```

### Example Output

The executable program should print the required result. An example of program output for the above input:

```
113400
```
